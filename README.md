## üü® JavaScript Core Concepts

### 1. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?  
**A:**  
- `var`: Function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared.  
- `let`: Block-scoped, not hoisted, cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned.  
- `const`: Block-scoped, not hoisted, cannot be redeclared or reassigned.

---

### 2. What is a closure in JavaScript?  
**A:**  
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when the outer function has finished executing.

---

### 3. What is event delegation?  
**A:**  
Attaching a single event listener to a parent element to manage events from its child elements via event bubbling.

---

### 4. Explain prototypal inheritance.  
**A:**  
JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype object, allowing shared functionality without classes.

---

### 5. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?  
**A:**  
- `==`: Loose equality with type coercion.  
- `===`: Strict equality without type coercion.

---

### 6. What is the event loop?  
**A:**  
It's a mechanism that handles asynchronous callbacks by processing the call stack and task queue to enable non-blocking I/O.

---

### 7. What are promises and async/await?  
**A:**  
Promises represent the result of async operations; `async/await` provides cleaner syntax to write asynchronous code using promises.

---

### 8. What are arrow functions and how do they differ?  
**A:**  
Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and do **not** have their own `this`, `arguments`, or `prototype`.

---

### 9. Explain "this" keyword in JavaScript.  
**A:**  
"this" references the object that is executing the current function, with its value determined by how the function is called.

---

### 10. What is the difference between call, apply, and bind?  
**A:**  
- `call`: Invokes a function with a specified this and individual arguments.
- `apply`: Invokes a function with a specified this and arguments as an array.
- `bind`: Returns a new function with a bound this and optional preset arguments.

---

### 11. Explain JavaScript's memory management and garbage collection.  
**A:**  
JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they're no longer referenced. Garbage collection identifies and removes unreachable objects.

---

### 12. What are Web Workers?  
**A:**  
Background threads for executing scripts separate from the main thread, enabling concurrent processing without blocking the UI.

---

### 13. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?  
**A:**  
- Synchronous: Code executes sequentially, blocking until current operation completes.
- Asynchronous: Operations continue executing without waiting for long-running tasks to complete.

---

## ‚öõÔ∏è React Core Concepts

### 14. What is JSX?  
**A:**  
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML and transpiles to `React.createElement()` calls.

---

### 15. What is the virtual DOM?  
**A:**  
An in-memory representation of the real DOM that React uses to batch and optimize updates.

---

### 16. Explain `useState` and `useEffect`.  
**A:**  
- `useState`: Hook to manage component state.

---

### 17. What is the Context API?  
**A:**  
A way to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.

---

### 18. Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?  
**A:**  
- Controlled: Form inputs controlled by React state.  
- Uncontrolled: Inputs managed by the DOM, accessed via refs.

---

### 19. What is reconciliation?  
**A:**  
React's process to compare virtual DOM trees and efficiently update the real DOM.

---

---

### 25. What is React's Strict Mode?  
**A:**  
A development-only mode that identifies potential problems by intentionally double-invoking functions and highlighting deprecated APIs.

---

### 26. How does React handle error boundaries?  
**A:**  
Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI.

---

### 27. Explain the difference between React state and props.  
**A:**  
- State: Private internal data managed by the component itself.
- Props: External data passed to a component from its parent.

---

**A:**  
Server-side functions that handle HTTP requests in the app directory, replacing API routes from the pages directory.

---

### 37. Explain the differences between the app directory and pages directory.  
**A:**  
App directory supports React Server Components, shared layouts, intercepting routes, and nested routes, while pages directory uses the older pages router.
